## Apachectl -k __ (Debian)

apache recommends apachectl -k vs service

stop
: kills all of its threads and exits

graceful (equivalent to service apache2 reload)
: advise it threads to exit when idle, then apache reloads the configuration (it doesn't exit itself)

restart (equivalent to service apache2 stop; service apache2 start)
: kills all of its threads, then the apache reloads the configuration file, rather than killing itself (similar to graceful)

graceful-stop
: like graceful, but instead of reloading the configuration, it will stop responding to new requests

## systemctl vs service

systemctl
- "low-level"
- higher control

service
- "high-level"
- abstracts various service managers
   - service redirects to systemctl on centos7

Use it as a local file:
  /Users/chris/.symfony5/bin/symfony

Or add the following line to your shell configuration file:
  export PATH="$HOME/.symfony5/bin:$PATH" # (chris) expires when terminal is closed

Or install it globally on your system:
  mv /Users/chris/.symfony5/bin/symfony /usr/local/bin/symfony #makes executable runnable from anywhere on the system

Then start a new shell and run 'symfony'
